== IRC Quickstart

IRC can also be overwhelming for new users. This quickstart shows you
the easiest way to connect to IRC. 

. In your browser open <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net" target="_blank">http://webchat.freenode.net</a>

. Fill out the form.

|===
|*Nickname* |The short name you want to be known as in IRC.
|*Channels* |`#docker`
|*reCAPTCHA* |Use the value provided.
|===

. Click "Connect".

The system connects you to chat. You'll see a lot of text. At the bottom of
the display is a command line. Just above the command line the system asks
you to register.

. In the command line, register your nickname.

----
/msg NickServ REGISTER password youremail@example.com
----

The IRC system sends an email to the address you
enter. The email contains instructions for completing your registration.

. Open your mail client and look for the email.

----
/msg NickServ VERIFY REGISTER moxiegirl_ acljtppywjnr
----

. Join the `#docker` group using the following command.

----
/j #docker
----

You can also join the `#docker-dev` group.

----

----

. To ask questions to the channel just type messages in the command line.

. To quit, close the browser window.

=== Tips and learning more about IRC

Next time you return to log into chat, you'll need to re-enter your password
on the command line using this command:

----
/msg NickServ identify <password>
----

If you forget or lose your password see <a
href="https://freenode.net/faq.shtml#sendpass" target="_blank">the FAQ on
freenode.net</a> to learn how to recover it.

This quickstart was meant to get you up and into IRC very quickly. If you find
IRC useful there is a lot more to learn. Drupal, another open source project,
actually has <a href="https://www.drupal.org/irc/setting-up" target="_blank">
written a lot of good documentation about using IRC</a> for their project
(thanks Drupal!).
