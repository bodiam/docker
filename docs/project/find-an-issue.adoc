= Find and claim an issue

On this page, you choose what you want to work on. As a contributor you can work
on whatever you want. If you are new to contributing, you should start by
working with our known issues.

== Understand the issue types

An existing issue is something reported by a Docker user. As issues come in,
our maintainers triage them. Triage is its own topic. For now, it is important
for you to know that triage includes ranking issues according to difficulty. 

Triaged issues have one of these labels:

|===
|Level |Experience level guideline
|*exp/beginner* |You have made less than 10 contributions in your life time to any open source project.
|*exp/novice* |You have made more than 10 contributions to an open source project or at least 5 contributions to Docker.
|*exp/proficient* |You have made more than 5 contributions to Docker which amount to at least 200 code lines or 1000 documentation lines.
|*exp/expert* |You have made less than 20 commits to Docker which amount to 500-1000 code lines or 1000-3000 documentation lines.
|*exp/master* |You have made more than 20 commits to Docker and greater than 1000 code lines or 3000 documentation lines.
|===

As the table states, these labels are meant as guidelines. You might have
written a whole plugin for Docker in a personal project and never contributed to
Docker. With that kind of experience, you could take on an <strong
class="gh-label expert">exp/expert</strong> or <strong class="gh-label
master">exp/master</strong> level task.

== Claim a beginner or novice issue

In this section, you find and claim an open documentation lines issue.

. Go to the `docker/docker` <a
href="https://github.com/docker/docker" target="_blank">repository</a>.

. Click on the "Issues" link.

A list of the open issues appears. 

image:/project/images/issue_list.png[Open issues]

. Look for the <strong class="gh-label beginner">exp/beginner</strong> items on the list.

. Click on the "labels" dropdown and select <strong class="gh-label beginner">exp/beginner</strong>.

The system filters to show only open <strong class="gh-label beginner">exp/beginner</strong> issues.

. Open an issue that interests you.

The comments on the issues can tell you both the problem and the potential
solution.

. Make sure that no other user has chosen to work on the issue.

We don't allow external contributors to assign issues to themselves. So, you
need to read the comments to find if a user claimed the issue by leaving a
`#dibs` comment on the issue. 

. When you find an open issue that both interests you and is unclaimed, add a
`#dibs` comment.

This example uses issue 11038. Your issue # will be different depending on
 what you claimed. After a moment, Gordon the Docker bot, changes the issue
 status to claimed.

. Make a note of the issue number; you'll need it later.

== Sync your fork and create a new branch

If you have followed along in this guide, you forked the `docker/docker`
repository. Maybe that was an hour ago or a few days ago. In any case, before
you start working on your issue, sync your repository with the upstream
`docker/docker` master. Syncing ensures your repository has the latest
changes.

To sync your repository:

. Open a terminal on your local host.

. Change directory to the `docker-fork` root.

----
$ cd ~/repos/docker-fork
----

. Checkout the master branch.

----
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
----

Recall that `origin/master` is a branch on your remote GitHub repository.

. Make sure you have the upstream remote `docker/docker` by listing them.

----
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/moxiegirl/docker.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/moxiegirl/docker.git (push)
upstream    https://github.com/docker/docker.git (fetch)
upstream    https://github.com/docker/docker.git (push)
----

If the `upstream` is missing, add it.

----
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/docker/docker.git
----

. Fetch all the changes from the `upstream master` branch.

----
$ git fetch upstream master
remote: Counting objects: 141, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (29/29), done.
remote: Total 141 (delta 52), reused 46 (delta 46), pack-reused 66
Receiving objects: 100% (141/141), 112.43 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (79/79), done.
From github.com:docker/docker
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
----

This command says get all the changes from the `master` branch belonging to
the `upstream` remote.

. Rebase your local master with the `upstream/master`.

----
$ git rebase upstream/master
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Fast-forwarded master to upstream/master.
----

This command applies all the commits from the upstream master to your local
master.

. Check the status of your local branch.

----
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 38 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
nothing to commit, working directory clean
----

Your local repository now has all the changes from the `upstream` remote. You
need to push the changes to your own remote fork which is `origin master`.

. Push the rebased master to `origin master`.

----
$ git push origin master
Username for 'https://github.com': moxiegirl
Password for 'https://moxiegirl@github.com': 
Counting objects: 223, done.
Compressing objects: 100% (38/38), done.
Writing objects: 100% (69/69), 8.76 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 69 (delta 53), reused 47 (delta 31)
To https://github.com/moxiegirl/docker.git
   8e107a9..5035fa1  master -> master
----

. Create a new feature branch to work on your issue.

Your branch name should have the format `XXXX-descriptive` where `XXXX` is
the issue number you are working on. For example:

----
$ git checkout -b 11038-fix-rhel-link
Switched to a new branch '11038-fix-rhel-link'
----

Your branch should be up-to-date with the `upstream/master`. Why? Because you
branched off a freshly synced master. Let's check this anyway in the next
step.

. Rebase your branch from upstream/master.

----
$ git rebase upstream/master
Current branch 11038-fix-rhel-link is up to date.
----

At this point, your local branch, your remote repository, and the Docker
repository all have identical code. You are ready to make changes for your
issue.
